It’s a matter of delight that department of CSE, IUT is going to organize “IUT 6th National ICT Fest 2014” a great pride and honour of IUT computer society. ICT Fest provide the platform to the novice of technology. Again, it’s a platform for new discovery and new challenge to the students of Public and Private Universities, including schools and colleges of Bangladesh.
On this important occasion, I extend my warm congratulations and felicitations to the participants and organizers of the contest. I anticipate that this event will be enthusiastic as well as competitive to the newcomer. I firmly believe IUTCS will make it a continuous process in the years to come giving opportunities to the talented students to prove their ability in various aspects of ICT and continue their due share for building a Digital Bangladesh.
I have come to know that IUT Computer Society (IUTCS) was formed by the students of Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in 2008.It is also appreciable that IUTCS is also appreciating students from different sectors to participate in the programming contests and classes, application development classes, co-curricular aid and projects, workshops and seminars and also ‘ICT Fest’.
 The idea of national ICT Fest conceived by IUTCS encourages knowledge exchange, research, development, ICT awareness, identity prospective fields and collaborations among the various parties involved for the overall development of the ICT sector.
Events like National ICT Fest bring together key ICT professionals, researchers and the mass population on a large scale. New information gathering and new ideas are welcomed on this type of event which is a testimony for a nation to step forward. 
I wish “IUT 6th National ICT Fest 2014” a grand success and hope that IUTCS would organize similar programs and activities in the ICT sector in the regional and International level as well.
